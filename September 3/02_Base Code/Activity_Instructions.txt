Goals:
	- To be able to implement the javascript files.
	- To be able to complete the implementation for 'Register Dish' Screen.
	
Things to be implemented:
1. File location: js/bentoDish.js
	1.1. Function: changeTypeImage()
		This function is used to change the image of the 'dish' type depending on the
		selected type.
	
	1.2. Function: validateDishNameExists()
		This function is used to check if the inputted 'dish' name already exists in the
		dishArray array. The array is traversed to look for the same 'dish' name.
		If same name was found from the array, an alert will be displayed. This function returns 'true' if 
		the 'dish' name does not exists in the array.
			
			
	1.3. Function: registerDish()	
		This function is used to insert a 'dish' item to the 'dishArray' array. There will be confirmation
		from the user before inserting the item. There will be a validation of the name if it exists in the 'dishArray' array
		using the validateNameExists() function. After the validation, the item is added to the 'dishArray' array.
		NOTE:
			A dish contains: id, name, type, price
			This data is got from the screen.
